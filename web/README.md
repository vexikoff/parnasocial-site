# Parnasocial

![Screenshot](ghassets/Screenshot.png)

A Windows desktop media player project in early development.

The goal is a local-first player: no account, no cloud, no telemetry. The current state is an interface prototype. Media playback, folder scanning, playlist management, and full settings are not implemented yet.

## Platform

Windows only. The application targets `win32` and `x64`. The main process exits immediately when launched on another platform.

[Linux and mac](https://github.com/vexikoff/parnasocial-mac-linux/)

## Tech stack

- Electron as the desktop shell.
- Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the renderer.
- Preload bridge with context isolation and sandbox enabled.
- `localStorage` for client-side preferences such as theme.
- `electron-builder` for packaging Windows NSIS installer and portable executable.

## Current interface

The window uses a frameless layout with native Windows controls overlay. The overlay height is 36 pixels and should match the custom header height.

The interface currently contains:

- Header with application icon, title, and settings button.
- Left panel with folder/search action buttons.
- Center player area with greeting, track placeholder, transport buttons, and volume slider.
- Right panel with playlist action buttons.
- Settings panel that can be toggled visually.

Most media controls are placeholders until playback logic is added.

`node_modules` and IDE folders are not part of the source layout.

## Run from source

Requirements:

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- npm 10 or newer.

  npm install
  npm start

## Build for Windows

    npm run dist

The build output is placed in:

    release/<version>/

The Windows build produces:

- NSIS installer.
- Portable executable.

Both use:

    assets/Parnasocial.ico

for application, installer, and uninstaller icons.

## Renderer bridge

The preload script exposes a limited `window.parnasocial` API to the renderer.

Available bridge areas:

- `app.getInfo()` returns basic application and runtime information.
- `window.minimize()`, `window.toggleMaximize()`, `window.close()`, `window.isMaximized()`, and `window.onMaximized()` control or observe the main window.
- `getWindowsUsername()` returns the current Windows username for the greeting text.
- `changeth()` sends a theme change event to the main process.

Native title bar overlay theme synchronization is not finished yet.

## Theme

The renderer stores a theme flag in `localStorage` under the key `yaebalneironki`.

Accepted values:

- `0` for light theme.
- `1` for dark theme.

The value is applied to the document root through the `data-theme` attribute.

Theme handling is still incomplete and should not be treated as final.

## Security model

The current Electron configuration uses conservative defaults:

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- `sandbox: true`
- `webSecurity: true`
- `allowRunningInsecureContent: false`
- `experimentalFeatures: false`
- DevTools are disabled in packaged builds.
- New window creation is denied.
- Navigation away from the current page is blocked.
- WebView attachment is blocked.
- Permission requests are limited to clipboard access.

No remote content loading is configured in the current renderer.

## Known limitations

- Media playback is not implemented.
- Folder buttons do not open or scan folders yet.
- Playlist buttons do not manage playlists yet.
- Volume slider is visual only.
- Settings panel is only toggled visually.
- Theme synchronization with the native Windows title bar overlay is incomplete.
- The project is Windows-only.
